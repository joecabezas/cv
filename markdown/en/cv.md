        Senior Software Engineer
        Checkr, San Francisco, USA

            * [2018] In response to customers' demand for automated decision-making based on candidate
            records, I initiated the development of the Assess Project. Within a year, the project emerged
            as the flagship product of the company, leading to the establishment of a dedicated team, I
            onboarded and mentored 4 engineers to join the team. In 2020 Assess product unblocked over 1.5
            million candidates, 96.5% of those people were determined to be Eligible by Checkr Assess, it
            lowered our customers adjudication costs by 90% and reduced the adjudication times by 70%.

            https://checkr.com/products/assess

            * [2021] I conducted an in-depth exploration of the underlying rules check engine and recommended
            the development of our own engine which is soon to be released as open source. As part of this
            initiative, I designed a domain-specific language (DSL) named JsonLisp, which enables customers
            to formulate rules using modern language features and is JSON compatible. The engine's
            implementation resulted in a 600% improvement in processing times and empowered Assess product
            customers to create highly intricate rules.
            In recognition for the improvements of the engine and the language proposed I got promoted in 2021

	Mar 2015 - Aug 2018
		Software Development Engineer
		Amazon, Seattle, USA

			* [2015] Part of a team responsible for creating a new feature from scratch, we used
			technologies like AWS, DynamoDB, Redshift, Ruby on Rails and front-end technologies like
			Jquery and Haml. We developed highly scalable services and fully testable code, using
			technologies like RSpec.

			* [2016] Part of a team responsible for creating a new feature for the Amazon Mobile App,
			I created highly scalable services using technologies like AWS, DynamoDB and frameworks
			like Spring with fully testable code, using technologies like JUnit, Mockito, EasyMock,
			and Hamcrest.

			* [2018] Launched Amazon Spark
			Amazon Spark is a place to discover things from people who share your interests. Whether you’re
			looking for inspiration for home décor or seeking advice for the best long-distance running
			shoes, Spark makes it easy to discover (and shop) stories and ideas from a community that likes
			what you like.

			I was part of the backend engineering team, I worked in the workflows systems handling the
			async nature of the user's interactions, I owned the metrics and analytic pipeline and
			worked with pm's to measure the business impact. I worked on moderation pieces and developed
			a framework for continuous deployment for AWS Lambdas using multiple accounts for different
			deployment stages.
